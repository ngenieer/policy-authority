# DECLARATION

## A Declaration of Fixed Responsibility

This project exists to assert a simple principle:

> **Decisions that affect others must be anchored to criteria that can be named, fixed, and defended.**

In an era where AI systems can generate changes faster than humans can review them, responsibility has become diffuse. Outcomes happen, but ownership disappears.

Policy Authority was created to reverse that drift.

## What We Believe

1. **Decisions precede execution**  
   A system that decides at runtime is not accountable. Decisions must be made *before* execution and recorded in a form that survives time.

2. **Criteria must be explicit**  
   If a rule cannot be written down, versioned, and cited, it cannot be enforced with integrity.

3. **Authority must be attributable**  
   Every enforced policy must have an issuer that can be named and questioned. Anonymous authority is no authority at all.

4. **Automation does not absolve responsibility**  
   AI may execute faster, but it does not carry blame. Responsibility remains human, whether acknowledged or not.

## What This System Refuses to Do

- It does not improvise.
- It does not optimize for convenience.
- It does not reinterpret intent.
- It does not replace judgment with probability.

When criteria are unclear, the system fails rather than guessing.

## Why This Must Be Open

Trust cannot be demanded from a black box.

The mechanisms that:
- construct policy snapshots,
- evaluate changes,
- and produce verdicts

must be visible, reproducible, and inspectable by anyone affected by their outcomes.

Opacity shifts responsibility. Transparency fixes it.

## Why Authority Remains Deliberate

While mechanisms are open, authority is not automatic.

To issue a policy is to accept the burden of explanation.
To sign a snapshot is to declare:

> “We stand behind these criteria, and we will answer for their consequences.”

This responsibility cannot be crowdsourced or inferred.

## The Role of This Project

Policy Authority is not a governor of behavior.
It is a record of commitment.

It ensures that when something is accepted or rejected, the answer to *why* is preserved, even after memory fades and people move on.

## Closing Statement

> **Systems do not create accountability.**  
> **They only reveal whether it was ever present.**

Policy Authority exists to make that revelation unavoidable.
