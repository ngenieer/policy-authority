# Policy Authority v0.x Roadmap  
*(Infrastructure-only Phase)*

## Purpose of This Roadmap

This document defines how **Policy Authority evolves within v0.x**,  
**without expanding beyond infrastructure-level policy enforcement**.

v0.x is intentionally constrained to prove that authority can exist as:

- Deterministic
- Irreversible
- FAIL-only
- Non-interpretive
- Responsibility-bound

This roadmap **does not prepare** for application, organizational, or behavioral policy.  
Those belong to a different phase and are **explicitly excluded here**.

---

## Scope Boundary (Constitutional)

### In Scope (v0.x)

Policy Authority v0.x applies **only to declarative infrastructure artifacts**.

- **Infrastructure targets**
  - Terraform
  - Kubernetes
- Snapshot-based policy enforcement
- Offline, deterministic evaluation
- File-based or AST-based parsing
- Schema-level validation
- Append-only governance records

> Infrastructure is treated strictly as **static state description**,  
> never as runtime behavior.

---

### Explicitly Out of Scope (v0.x)

The following are **intentionally excluded**, not postponed:

- Web infrastructure (routing, headers, CDN, edge, request-level config)
- Application logic
- Data governance
- Organizational or human rules
- Workflow orchestration
- Runtime observation or feedback
- AI agent behavior control
- Any domain requiring intent or context interpretation

> v0.x refuses domains where policy meaning depends on runtime interaction.

---

## v0.1 → v0.2: Engine Evolution (Append-only)

### v0.1 (Baseline)

- File-based / substring-level evaluation
- Deterministic verdicts from raw artifacts
- Minimal structural assumptions
- Maximum semantic conservatism

v0.1 establishes the **irreversibility and determinism contract**.

---

### v0.2 (Planned)

- Parser-based evaluation (e.g. HCL / YAML AST)
- Stronger structural guarantees
- Reduced ambiguity **without altering v0.1 semantics**

#### Hard Rules

- Engine versions are **append-only**
- A snapshot evaluated with v0.1 **must always be evaluated with v0.1**
- No automatic migration
- No semantic reinterpretation

> Meaning is frozen by version.  
> Evolution happens by addition, never by mutation.

---

## Infrastructure Frames (v0.x)

v0.x may expand **within infrastructure**, but only under strict constraints.

Allowed frame domains:
- Terraform
- Kubernetes

Frame constraints:
- Describe **static, declarative state**
- Do not observe runtime behavior
- Do not infer intent
- Do not execute or apply changes
- Do not depend on environment-specific context

Frames are **descriptive**, never operational.

---

## Snapshot Tooling (Reference Only)

To support reproducible usage, v0.x may include **reference tooling**, such as:

- Snapshot builders
- Snapshot validators
- Signature helpers
- Offline verification CLI

### Constitutional Clarification

- Tooling is **not the authority**
- Authority is defined solely by:
  - Snapshot format
  - Engine semantics
  - Validation rules

Any third party must be able to:
- Reimplement tooling independently
- Produce identical snapshots and verdicts

> Tools are conveniences, not sources of power.

---

## Validation & Reproducibility Hardening

Trust in v0.x is achieved through **mechanical verification**, not intelligence.

Planned reinforcements:
- Formal schemas for:
  - Policy
  - Snapshot
  - Verdict
- Official schema validator
- CI templates enforcing:
  - Deterministic verdicts
  - Normalized artifact stability

Rules:
- Validators output only PASS / FAIL
- No auto-fix or suggestion
- Failure halts evaluation

---

## Examples & Determinism Tests

The `examples/` directory exists to **prove invariants**, not to teach usage.

Includes:
- Terraform PASS cases
- Terraform FAIL cases
- Kubernetes PASS cases
- Kubernetes FAIL cases
- Repeated-run tests verifying:
  - Verdict determinism
  - Normalized artifact identity

This demonstrates that the system behaves like **physics**, not judgment.

---

## Governance Records (Minimal, Append-only)

v0.x governance exists only to ensure **responsibility traceability**.

Includes:
- Snapshot issuance logs
- Issuer public key records
- Engine version references

Constraints:
- Append-only
- No interpretation
- No enforcement logic
- No central authority escalation

> Governance records accountability, not control.

---

## What v0.x Is Not Becoming

This roadmap explicitly rejects the following trajectories:

- A policy platform
- A compliance service
- An orchestration system
- A decision engine
- An AI governance layer

If Policy Authority expands into such domains,  
it must do so **outside v0.x** and under a different constitutional model.

---

## Summary

> Policy Authority v0.x evolves by becoming  
> **more exact, more reproducible, and more constrained** —  
> not by becoming broader, smarter, or more powerful.
