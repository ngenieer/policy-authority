## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document is the constitutional self-binding contract
for an individual Frame admitted into the Policy Authority system.

This document does NOT describe usage.
This document does NOT explain behavior.
This document does NOT provide guarantees.

This document exists solely to define
what this Frame explicitly refuses to do.

---

## 2. Identity of the Frame

- Frame Name:
- Frame Identifier:
- Admission Reference (Authority decision / snapshot hash):
- Version:

This identity is immutable once admitted.
Any change constitutes a new Frame.

---

## 3. Formal Snapshot Boundary

This Frame is defined strictly by the following formal artifacts:

- Included file formats:
- Included directory scope:
- Explicitly excluded files, directories, and artifacts:

Anything not explicitly included here
is constitutionally outside the Frame.

---

## 4. Determinism Commitment

This Frame affirms that:

- Snapshots are derivable from static files only
- Snapshot derivation does NOT depend on:
  - Runtime state
  - Execution results
  - Network access
  - Environment variables
  - System clocks
  - External services

If this commitment becomes false,
this Frame is constitutionally invalid.

---

## 5. Execution Exclusion Declaration

This Frame explicitly refuses:

- Execution of artifacts
- Simulation of behavior
- Validation against real systems
- Inspection of runtime outcomes

Any requirement for execution
places the problem outside this Frame.

---

## 6. Semantic Non-Interpretation Clause

This Frame explicitly refuses to interpret:

- Business intent
- Operational correctness
- Safety implications
- Ethical or legal meaning
- Real-world consequences

Policy evaluation within this Frame
operates purely on formal structure.

---

## 7. Fail-Only Evaluation Guarantee

This Frame guarantees that:

- Evaluation outcomes are binary: PASS or FAIL
- No partial success is recognized
- No auto-correction is performed
- No tolerance or best-effort behavior exists

Ambiguity results in failure.

---

## 8. Explicit Non-Goals

This Frame explicitly does NOT:

- Guarantee safety
- Prevent misuse
- Ensure correctness
- Detect malicious intent
- Protect users from consequences
- Align outcomes with stated intent

No expectation beyond formal recording is valid.

---

## 9. Responsibility Attribution

For this Frame:

- The Authority approves form only
- The Issuer bears full responsibility for:
  - Policy meaning
  - Execution results
  - Operational impact
  - Legal and ethical consequences

No responsibility is transferred to the Authority.

---

## 10. Frame Self-Invalidation Clause

If any statement in this constitution
is violated or bypassed in practice:

- The Frame MUST be considered invalid
- Past evaluations MUST NOT be relied upon
- Continued use is at the Issuer’s sole risk

No remediation obligation exists.

---

## 11. Final Declaration

This Frame exists only as long as
it refuses to understand the world it observes.

Understanding contaminates.
Execution corrupts.
Convenience erodes trust.

This constitution binds the Frame,
not the Authority.
