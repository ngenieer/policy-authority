# Authority Limits and Self‑Binding Declaration

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the **self‑imposed limits** of the Authority Company.

It exists to make clear that authority in this system is not based on discretion, expertise, or moral judgment, but on **procedural restraint, public record, and user choice**.

This document is binding on the Authority Company itself.

---

## 2. Definition of Authority Company

In this document, **Authority Company** refers to the legal entity that:

- Defines and maintains the Authority Frame
- Publishes official Policy Snapshots
- Maintains Evaluation Engine specifications
- Records and publishes frame and snapshot changes

It does **not** refer to organizations that merely use this system.

---

## 3. Scope of Authority

The Authority Company MAY:

- Define the structure (schema) of the Authority Frame
- Publish new versions of the Authority Frame
- Publish official Policy Snapshots
- Approve or revoke Issuer status

The Authority Company MAY NOT:

- Determine whether a user decision is correct or incorrect
- Enforce how users act on PASS or FAIL outcomes
- Retroactively alter past evaluations
- Modify a Policy Snapshot without public record

---

## 4. Immutability and Public Record

All Authority Frame versions:

- Are published in a public repository
- Are versioned and tagged
- Remain permanently accessible

Past versions MUST NOT be deleted or silently altered.

This guarantees that historical decisions remain inspectable and reproducible.

---

## 5. Change as a Declared Event

Any change to the Authority Frame:

- MUST be published as a new version
- MUST include a written change declaration
- MUST describe scope, motivation, and impact
- MUST NOT invalidate past snapshots or verdicts

Undeclared or silent changes are considered non‑official and void.

---

## 6. Non‑Coercion Principle

Use of any Authority Frame version is **voluntary**.

The Authority Company:

- MAY recommend newer versions
- MAY deprecate older versions
- MAY NOT force migration

Users retain full autonomy over version selection.

---

## 7. No Outcome Control

The Authority Company:

- Provides evaluation mechanisms
- Records evaluation outcomes

It does NOT:

- Mandate operational decisions
- Override human or organizational judgment
- Assume responsibility for outcomes

Responsibility for decisions remains with the user organization.

---

## 8. Issuer Revocation

Issuer approval MAY be revoked if:

- Issuer violates declared issuance procedures
- Issuer falsifies records or attribution

Revocation MUST:

- Be publicly recorded
- Include stated reasons
- Not alter previously issued snapshots

---

## 9. Verification Over Trust

This system does not ask users to trust the Authority Company.

Instead, it provides:

- Publicly inspectable rules
- Reproducible evaluation mechanisms
- Immutable historical records

Trust emerges from **verifiability**, not reputation.

---

## 10. Final Declaration

The Authority Company binds itself to the constraints defined in this document.

Authority exists only within these limits.

Any action outside these limits is non‑authoritative by definition.
