## General Principle

Frame rejection is not a failure.
It is the default outcome.

No justification beyond boundary violation is required.

---

## Template R-01: Determinism Violation

This Frame proposal is rejected.

Snapshot derivation depends on factors outside static file artifacts.
This violates the determinism requirement of Policy Authority.

No remediation is possible within this system.

---

## Template R-02: Execution Dependency

This Frame proposal is rejected.

Understanding or validating policy impact requires execution,
simulation, or runtime inspection.

Policy Authority does not admit execution-dependent Frames.

---

## Template R-03: Semantic Contamination

This Frame proposal is rejected.

Policy evaluation requires interpretation of meaning, intent,
or real-world consequences.

Policy Authority explicitly refuses semantic understanding.

---

## Template R-04: Boundary Ambiguity

This Frame proposal is rejected.

The snapshot boundary cannot be defined precisely without ambiguity.
Ambiguous boundaries invalidate Authority guarantees.

---

## Template R-05: Convenience-Oriented Design

This Frame proposal is rejected.

The proposal introduces tolerance, auto-correction,
or user-convenience mechanisms.

Convenience is incompatible with fail-only evaluation.

---

## Template R-06: Implicit Guarantees

This Frame proposal is rejected.

The proposal implies safety, correctness,
or outcome guarantees beyond formal recording.

Policy Authority provides no such guarantees.

---

## Template R-07: Insufficient Failure Disclosure

This Frame proposal is rejected.

Failure modes and misuse scenarios are insufficiently enumerated.
Unacknowledged risk is grounds for rejection.

---

## Template R-08: Default Rejection

This Frame proposal is rejected.

The proposer has not met the burden required to override
the default rejection stance of the Authority.

No further explanation is necessary.

---

## Closing Statement (Optional)

Rejection preserves the integrity of the Authority.
Admission requires exceptional justification.
